<!--
    Div = these basically used to divide elements into seperate sections, But since it's a block elements it'll make a new line
    span = these are used when we want to divide the element but don't want to make a new line, because span is a inline element.

    id = these usually referred by css to change the color/anything of a individual element.
    class = these are just same as id but, these can contain a group of elements and we can modify the group of elements using css.
